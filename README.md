# ðŸ§  Income Prediction ML Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K/year based on demographic and employment-related features. It is built using Python and explored in a Jupyter Notebook format.

##  Dataset

This project likely uses the **UCI Adult Income Dataset**, which includes information such as:

- Age  
- Workclass  
- Education  
- Marital Status  
- Occupation  
- Race  
- Gender  
- Hours-per-week  
- Native country  
- Income (target: >50K or <=50K)

###  1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and categorical encoding
- Feature engineering
- Label encoding or one-hot encoding

### âœ… 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Class imbalance check
- Correlation between features

### âœ… 3. Model Training
- Algorithms used may include:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree / Random Forest
  - XGBoost / Gradient Boosting
  - SVM, etc.

### âœ… 4. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
